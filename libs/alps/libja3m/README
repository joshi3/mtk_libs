This module creates the MAGE (MediaTek Android Graphics Environment) A3M 3D
graphics engine libraries.

This library is pre-built by MediaTek internally.


WHAT IT DOES?
=============
A3M is the native graphics engine which is used in conjunction with the ngin3D
Java framework.  These two components form the MAGE middleware used for 2D/3D
graphics applications.

liba3m.so contains the A3M graphics engine.
libja3m.so contains the native side JNI interface for the A3M engine.

HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================
It needs the following library from AOSP:

libEGL, libGLESv2, libandroid, libcutils, liblog, libstlport and libutils

and the following libs from MediaTek:

libmtk_drvb.so

All source/dependency modules of this module are already put in
'vendor/mediatek/libs' folder.

HOW TO USE IT?
==============

The A3M libraries should not be used directly by an application developer.  The
ngin3D framework provides a more suitable API
(vendor/mediatek/proprietary/framework/opt).

The majority of source code for this library were written by MediaTek.  Various
open source libraries are also used and contained in this folder.
